I wanted to challenge myself by making a small but complete game in ONE WEEK so I made Mad Ball and uploaded on Itch.io!

Mad ball is a game where player is controlling a ball throwing it into the flying objects. To throw the ball, drag mouse button and release the mouse button to throw.
The more the drag amount, the more the force applied to the ball.

Check out the 6 minutes gameplay video that covers up all the features I made or you can download and Play:  https://parthvadera.itch.io/mad-ball
